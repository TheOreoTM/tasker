# Tasker

Tasker is a CLI tool to manage your tasks. It is written in Go and uses a local JSON (ðŸ¤®) file to store your tasks.

I made this project to learn cobra and go. It is not meant to be used in production/anyone because it is useless.
I am however making a v2 of this project that will be more useful and will use a database instead of a JSON file. And it will also have proper formatting using charmbracelet.
